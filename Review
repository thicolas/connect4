### Connect 4 Project Review

#### Overview
Your Connect 4 project effectively combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a dynamic scoreboard that tracks wins, which really does enhance the gameplay.

#### Highlights
- **Game Mechanics**: Smooth gameplay with well-implemented core functionality.
- **Scoreboard Feature**: Adds a competitive aspect by dynamically updating player victories.
- **Styling and Animation**: CSS animations improve visual appeal. (I would try to make the circle move behind the board)

#### Areas for Improvement
- **Responsive Design**: Implement responsive design for better accessibility across devices.
- **Code Optimization**: Optimize JavaScript for efficiency. Consider adjusting the `renderBoard` function for immediate response.
- **Accessibility**: Improve accessibility, e.g., keyboard navigation.
- **Documentation**: Enhance code documentation for better readability and maintenance.

#### Conclusion
A well-executed project showcasing your web development skills. Focusing on responsive design, code optimization, accessibility, and documentation will elevate your project further. Very good job. Well done.
